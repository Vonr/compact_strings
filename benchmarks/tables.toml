Overview = """
Only a few operations that are thought to have significant differences in
performance from their `Vec` equivalents are benchmarked and shown here.

The benchmark itself uses quite naive testing methods and are by no means
perfect. For example, the removal benchmarks also include the timing to
re-add elements to prevent the benchmark from exhausting the elements.

Furthermore, all the elements are of the same length and may lead to
favourable results for some of the data structures being benchmarked.
When pre-fixed with "-hello", all elements are "hello" - which is able
to fit in the 7 bytes of inline storage in the FixedCompact\* structures,
when pre-fixed with "-sphinx", all elements are "sphinx of black quartz,
judge my vow" - which are too long to fit into the 7 bytes of inline
storage.

Should you have ideas on how to better benchmark this, a pull request
would be greatly appreciated.

Row values, if any, indicate the number of (byte)strings in the list.

There may be performance implications, as the `Vec` structures likely
prefer larger (byte)strings while the chosen (byte)string is relatively small.

populate = """
This benchmarks the population of each list structure at various sizes.

The structures provided by this crate are expected to perform better than
the `Vec` equivalents as the data vector will grow rapidly in size to
accomodate for large numbers of new (byte)strings while the `Vec` equivalents
need to find and allocate new space for each new (byte)string.
"""

access = """
This benchmarks accessing each list structure *without bounds checks*.

The structures provided by this crate are expected to perform slightly worse
than the `Vec` equivalents as they require two accesses (one for metadata,
and one for the actual data), while the `Vec` equivalents only need one.
"""

iterate = """
This benchmarks iterating over each list structure.

The structures provided by this crate are expected to perform worse
than the `Vec` equivalents as they require two accesses (one for metadata,
and one for the actual data), while the `Vec` equivalents only need one.
"""

remove_first_element = """
This benchmarks removing the first element of each list structure.

The structures provided by this crate are expected to perform *significantly* worse
on this benchmark as all (byte)strings stored after the removed element need to
be shifted, causing a large reallocation.

The non-fixed structures provide the `ignore` method which only removes the metadata to combat
this at the cost of stale memory.

This benchmark is intentionally biased against the structures provided by this crate
in order to demonstrate pathological behaviour.
